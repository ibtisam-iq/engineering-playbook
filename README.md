# Engineering Playbook – Ibtisam

## About This Repository

This repository is a personal engineering knowledge base built by **Ibtisam**.

It focuses on **real-world technical problems** that engineers face in daily life — not theory, not tutorials, but actual system-level thinking and practical solution design.

This is not a collection of tools.
This is a collection of **engineering decisions**.

## Why This Exists

Most engineers know tools.
Very few engineers build **systems of thinking**.

This repository exists to:

* Document real technical problems I encounter
* Break down how an engineer should analyze them
* Design clean, secure and scalable solutions
* Help other engineers build better mental models

---

## What You Will Find Here

Each document in this repository follows a simple logic:

```
Problem → Confusion → Architecture Thinking → Structured Solution
```

Topics include:

* Multi-account email management
* Digital identity separation
* Secure password architecture
* Work vs Engineering system design
* Browser and device isolation strategies
* Real-world DevOps decision making

This repository is not theoretical.
Everything here is based on hands-on problem solving.

## Who This Is For

This repository is for:

* Engineers who want to think deeply
* DevOps and Infrastructure learners
* People who want systems, not shortcuts
* Builders who want long-term clarity

If you are only here for copy-paste commands, this repository is not for you.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized by **problem domains**, not by tools:

```
engineering-playbook/
├── email-systems/
├── identity-management/
├── password-strategy/
├── device-security/
├── workflows/
```

Each folder represents a category of engineering thinking.

## Philosophy

* Security first
* Privacy by design
* Minimal exposure
* Long-term clarity
* Real engineering is about decisions, not tools
